                                            <p>The Fundrise Rating quantifies the relative risk of each asset in an investor’s portfolio. An investor can find the risk ratings of the assets in their portfolio in the “<a href="https://fundrise.com/account/overview" title="">Your Account”</a> section of their dashboard.</p>

                                            <p>The Fundrise Rating uses a letter rating system ranging from A to E that provides investors with the ability to easily compare different assets across their portfolio. The Fundrise Rating system is meant to be objective and is driven by factual information about the investment—for example, whether an investment is “ground&shy; up development” or “stabilized,” or what the total leverage is on the asset. Fundrise Ratings are for informational purposes only.</p>

                                            <p>Each rating is impersonal and not individualized for any specific investor’s financial situation and is not investment advice. These ratings are not intended to be, nor should you interpret them to be, a prediction of how a particular investment will actually perform. Each investor should always carefully consider investments in any security and be comfortable with his/her understanding of the investment. An investor may also consider consulting an investment professional. The full Fundrise Rating matrix can be found <a href="https://fundrise.com/education/content/fundrise-rating" title="">here</a> along with explanations of each rating.</p>

The return is primarily paid out in two ways (i) via quarterly distributions and (ii) via appreciation in asset value at the end of the asset’s investment term. While most investors can expect to receive a quarterly distribution, distributions may be more or less frequent depending on an investor’s overall portfolio allocation, market conditions, and other factors. All distributions will be deposited into your primary bank account on file unless you opt into our Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). However, actual results may be different for each investor and there can be no guarantee of enhanced returns due to investing on Fundrise or the use of Fundrise Advisors’ services or recommendations.</p>

An eREIT is a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of commercial real estate assets, such as apartments, hotels, shopping centers, and office buildings from across the country. Similar to an ETF or mutual fund but specifically for commercial real estate, an eREIT allows an investor to diversify across many properties at a relatively low cost and with minimal effort. Fundrise eREITs are offered directly to investors via the Fundrise website, without any brokers or selling commissions.</p>

As they are non-traded, they generally have less liquidity than REITs that are publicly traded. They also have lower correlation to the broader market, and may therefore offer greater protection from market volatility.</p>

                                            <p>The Net Asset Value (NAV) per share represents the estimated value of a single share based on a variety of factors including potential changes in the underlying value of real estate assets owned. After an initial ramp-up period for each offering, NAV is typically adjusted on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. While NAV may be used to determine the Redemption Price of a share, it is only an estimate of value and the actual market price that someone would pay for such a share may vary widely. It is not uncommon for investors to see a decline in NAV during the first few quarters of operations (the “ramp-up” period) as a result of standard up front organizational costs as well as costs related to acquiring assets. Much like closing costs incurred during the purchase of a new home, these are generally not commonly recurring expenses, and are therefore unlikely to impact the long-term value of your shares.</p>

                                            <p>Each year, we are required to report to you the tax character of distributions paid to you, which is determined by comparing the amount of distributions paid by the eREIT with the eREIT’s earnings and profits for a given year. The eREIT’s calculated current and accumulated earnings and profits is the result of a tax calculation, which often differs from the eREIT’s profits calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and presented to you in such eREIT’s Annual Report on Form 1-K each year. </p>

                                            <p> In the event that any portion of distributions paid to you exceeds earnings and profits in a given year for the eREIT, it is treated as a non-dividend distribution, also referred to as a return of capital. Distributions that do not exceed the calculated current and accumulated earnings and profits are reflected as either an ordinary dividend or a capital gain distribution depending on the eREIT’s disposition activity related to real estate properties during the year. In general, ordinary and capital gain distributions are taxed currently; non-dividend distributions, or returns of capital, reduce cost basis or the original purchase value of your shares. In the event returns of capital received exceed your original cost basis, then the excess is recognized as a capital gain for the year in which it is received. Therefore, you should generally adjust the cost basis of your investment each year based on the amount shown in Box 3 “non-dividend distributions” on your Form 1099-DIV. By tracking adjustments to your cost basis each year, you will be able to properly report any gain or loss you experience on the disposition or redemption of your shares. </p>

                                            <p> When you sell your shares, the difference between your adjusted cost basis and final net sale price will be taxable as a capital gain or loss on your tax return. Keeping track of your adjusted cost basis each year will be helpful when you finally sell your investment. Please consult your tax advisor if you have any questions or need assistance with the calculation of your cost basis, or if you have other questions regarding your reporting of distributions that you received.</p>

                                            <p>A qualified dividend is a type of dividend which may be subject to preferential tax rates, which are usually lower than regular income tax rates. Non-qualified, ordinary dividends are taxed at the normal rate based on the individual’s ordinary income. Based on the historical operations of the eREITs and how we expect them to operate in the future, we do not expect most dividends that are issued by the eREITs will be qualified. However, to the extent that the eREITs do pay qualified dividends, they will report them as such in Box 1B.</p>

                                            <p>A K-1 is a tax form used by partnerships to provide investors with detailed information on their share of a partnership’s taxable income. Partnerships are generally not subject to federal or state income tax, but instead issue a K-1 to each investor to report his or her share of the partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits.  The K-1s are provided to investors on an annual basis so that each investor can include K-1 amounts on his or her tax return.</p>

                                            <p>Generally, investors that receive a Form 1099-DIV recognize dividend income equal to cash distributions received. Ordinary dividends are typically treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. When an investor receives a K-1, he or she will recognize their portion of the taxable income from the partnership but typically will not pay tax on their cash distributions. The taxable income allocated to each investor may include ordinary income, dividend income, interest income, rental real estate income, or otherwise. This income retains the same character as it had in the partnership, and should be reported on each investor’s federal tax return. Please consult your tax advisor for additional information.</p>
